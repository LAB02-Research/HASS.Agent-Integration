# HASS.Agent Integration

This <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a> integration allows you to send notifications to <a href="https://github.com/LAB02-Research/HASS.Agent" target="_blank">HASS.Agent</a>, a Windows-based Home Assistant client. It also allows you to use it as a mediaplayer device: see and control what's playing and send text-to-speech. 

All communication is done through MQTT: no more configuring the legacy local API. It also supports auto discovery, so you'll see your HASS.Agent devices show up automatically!

Need help? Check [the documentation](https://hassagent.readthedocs.io/), visit the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hass-agent-a-new-windows-based-client-to-receive-notifications-perform-quick-actions-and-much-more/369094" target="_blank">dedicated HA forum thread</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/nMvqzwrVBU" target="_blank">join on Discord</a>.

Note: it won't be of much use if you don't have HASS.Agent installed & configured on at least one PC (or Windows based device).

**IMPORTANT: There is currently no beta or public release available that uses this integration. It will be released in the coming weeks.**
